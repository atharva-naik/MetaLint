    "model_response = \"<think>\\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a code file and wants me to check for violations of the I001 idiom, which is about unsorted imports. The definition says that imports should be de-duplicated, grouped, and sorted based on isort settings. The example shows that the imports should be sorted, like numpy first then pandas.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the code file's imports. Let me scan through the code. The code starts with #!/usr/bin/python2, then line 3 has 'import requests', line 4 is 'import createDB as r'. So there are two imports here. \\n\\nNow, according to I001, these imports should be sorted. The example shows that in the correct version, numpy comes before pandas. But in the given code, the order is requests first, then createDB. However, the example in the problem shows that the correct order is numpy then pandas. Wait, but the example given in the problem is for a different code snippet. The user's code has two imports: requests and createDB. The problem is that the example shows that the imports should be sorted, but the code here has two imports. Are they sorted? Let me check the order. The code has 'import requests' followed by 'import createDB as r'. The example in the problem's definition shows that the correct order is numpy then pandas. So the correct order would be to sort them alphabetically. \\n\\nWait, the example given in the problem is:\\n\\nOriginal code:\\nimport pandas\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nUse instead:\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport pandas\\n\\nSo the correct order is to sort them alphabetically. So in the user's code, the imports are 'requests' and 'createDB as r'. If we sort them alphabetically, 'createDB' comes before 'requests'? Wait, 'createDB' starts with 'c', 'requests' starts with 'r', so 'createDB' would come first. But in the code, the order is 'requests' first. That's a violation. So the imports are not sorted in the correct order. \\n\\nBut wait, the code has two imports. The first is 'requests', then 'createDB as r'. The correct order would be 'createDB as r' first, then 'requests'. But the user's code has them in reverse order. So this is a violation of I001. \\n\\nBut wait, the example given in the problem shows that the correct order is sorted. So in the user's code, the imports are not sorted. Therefore, there's a violation. The fix would be to sort them alphabetically. \\n\\nSo the line numbers for the imports are 3 and 4. The original code has:\\n\\nLine 3: import requests\\nLine 4: import createDB as r\\n\\nThe correct order should be line 4 first, then line 3. So the violation is that the imports are not sorted. Therefore, the fix would be to swap their order. \\n\\nSo, the violation is in the imports. The code has two imports, but they are not sorted. The correct order is to sort them alphabetically. So the code violates I001. \\n\\nNow, the user's code has the imports in the order requests first, then createDB. So the violation is present. Therefore, the answer should indicate that there is a violation for I001, with the line numbers and the fix.\\n</think>\\n\\n### Final Idiom Violations Found\\n\\n**Idiom I001 Violations:**\\n\\n{\\\"line\\\": \\\" 3 \\\\t\\\\timport requests\\\", \\\"fix\\\": [{\\\"before\\\": \\\"import requests\\\\nimport createDB as r\\\", \\\"after\\\": \\\"import createDB as r\\\\nimport requests\\\"}]}\""
