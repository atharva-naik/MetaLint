While readers\nmay assume that UTF-8 is the default encoding, in reality, the default\nis locale-specific.\n\n\nInstead, consider using the encoding parameter to enforce a specific\nencoding. PEP 597 recommends the use of encoding=\"utf-8\" as a default,\nand suggests that it may become the default in future versions of Python.\n\n\nIf a local-specific encoding is intended, use encoding=\"local\" on\nPython 3.10 and later, or locale.getpreferredencoding() on earlier versions,\nto make the encoding explicit.",
