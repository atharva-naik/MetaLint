    "why-is-this-bad": "In Python, the __slots__ attribute allows you to explicitly define the\nattributes (instance variables) that a class can have. By default, Python\nuses a dictionary to store an object's attributes, which incurs some memory\noverhead. However, when __slots__ is defined, Python uses a more compact\ninternal structure to store the object's attributes, resulting in memory\nsavings.\n\n\nSubclasses of str inherit all the attributes and methods of the built-in\nstr class. Since strings are typically immutable, they don't require\nadditional attributes beyond what the str class provides. Defining\n__slots__ for subclasses of str prevents the creation of a dictionary\nfor each instance, reducing memory consumption.",
