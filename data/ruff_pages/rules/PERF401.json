    "why-is-this-bad": "When creating a transformed list from an existing list using a for-loop,\nprefer a list comprehension. List comprehensions are more readable and\nmore performant.\n\n\nUsing the below as an example, the list comprehension is ~10% faster on\nPython 3.11, and ~25% faster on Python 3.10.\n\n\nNote that, as with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a\nmicro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in\nmost cases.",
