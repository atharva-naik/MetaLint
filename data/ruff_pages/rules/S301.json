Instead, consider safer formats, such as JSON.\n\n\nIf you must deserialize untrusted data with pickle, consider signing the\ndata with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing the\npayload, This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary objects\ninto the serialized data.\n\n\nIn preview, this rule will also flag references to pickle functions.",
