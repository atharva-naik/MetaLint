Update the version of GStreamer included in FX/Media in order to improve
security, stability, and performance.
Non-Goals
It is not a goal to introduce any new functionality, e.g., dynamic
pipelines.
Motivation
The version of GStreamer included in FX/Media today is out of date, and
is missing stability and performance fixes made to GStreamer's C code
since June of 2011.  Updating from the current 0.10.35 version to a 1.x
version of GStreamer requires time and effort, and we would like to be
proactive in updating so that we can more easily respond to future
GStreamer security updates.
Description
The latest stable release of GStreamer is 1.4.4, released on 2014/11/10.
Integrating this release will require updating our existing plug-ins,
since it contains incompatible API changes.  The JFXMedia layer that
builds the GStreamer pipline should not require many changesd; it is most
likely already compatible with the latest GStreamer.
We will also need to update the copy of GLib included in FX/Media.  (This
is used on Windows and OS X, which do not themselves provide GLib; on
Linux we use the GLib provided by the distro.)  Our copy of GLib is
currently at version 2.28.8; the new GStreamer requires at least 2.32,
but it's better to take the latest, so we will update to GLib 2.42.1 and,
along with that, LibFFI 3.2.1.
Testing
No new tests are needed.
