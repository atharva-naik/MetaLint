Remove the source code and build support for the Windows 32-bit x86 port. This port was deprecated for removal in JDK 21 with the express intent to remove it in a future release.
Goals


Remove all code paths that apply only to Windows 32-bit x86.


Cease all testing and development efforts targeting the Windows 32-bit x86 platform.


Simplify the JDK's build and test infrastructure.


Non-Goals


It is not a goal to remove or change 32-bit support for any platforms other than Windows.


It is not a goal to remove either code or support for Windows 32-bit in previous releases.


Motivation


Allow contributors in the OpenJDK Community to accelerate the development of new features and enhancements that will move the platform forward.


The implementation of JEP 436 (Virtual Threads) for Windows x86-32 falls back to the use of kernel threads and therefore does not bring the expected benefits of Project Loom.


Windows 10, the last Windows operating system to support 32-bit operation, will reach End of Life in October 2025.


Description


Find and remove all code paths in the code base that apply only to Windows 32-bit.


Modify the JDK build system to remove support for compiling on Windows 32-bit platforms, and  halt testing activities for this architecture.


Update the JDK documentation to reflect the removal of Windows 32-bit support, and publicize this change so as to ensure a smooth transition for users and developers.


Risks and Assumptions
Some users may still rely on 32-bit Java applications on Windows. This change requires Java applications running on 32-bit Windows to migrate to a 64-bit JDK and Windows environment, or else remain on legacy versions of the JDK, prior to JDK 23, which still include 32-bit support. Transition guidance and support by distributions and vendors of JDK binaries will be critical.
