Upgrade the version of the Xerces XML parser included in the JDK with
important changes from Xerces 2.11.0.
Non-Goals
The JDK's copy of Xerces contains many changes and improvements that are
JDK-specific.  It is not a goal to completely synchronize the JDK
codebase with that of the Apache Xerces Project.
Success Metrics


Classes in the selected categories are fully updated.


Incompatibilities are not introduced.  Any conflicts with the
existing JDK code are resolved so as to prefer the existing JDK code.


Regressions do not occur.


Motivation
The JDK contains the older Xerces 2.7.1 parser.  During the development
of JDK 7, it was updated with all critical and many major changes from
Xerces 2.10.0.  Since then, Xerces 2.11.0 was released.  Upgrading to the
latest release will help improve the quality of the JDK implementation.
Description
Update the JDK with changes in the following categories from Xerces 2.11.0:

Datatypes,
DOM L3 Serializer,
XPointer,
Catalog Resolver, and
XML Schema Validation (including bug fixes, but not the XML Schema
1.1 development code).

There will be no changes to the JAXP public API.
This update will be done in batches.  Not every revision may be tested
individually.
Testing


Relevant tests in Xerces may be merged into the existing test suite.


New tests will be developed to ensure sufficient coverage of the
changes.


Significant testing will be required to ensure that the update does
not introduce regressions relative to the existing implementation.


Risks and Assumptions
Since the integration of Xerces 2.7.1 into JDK 6, many JDK-specific bug
fixes, improvements, and feature additions were implemented independently
of the Apache Xerces Project.  This includes the incorporation of the
StAX parser, which shared and modified the scanner implementation from
Xerces.  Some Xerces patches therefore may need to be modified to resolve
conflicts.
