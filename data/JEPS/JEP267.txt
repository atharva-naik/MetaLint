Upgrade existing platform APIs to support version 8.0 of the
Unicode Standard.
Goals
Support the latest version of Unicode, with changes to the following
classes:

Character and String in the java.lang package,
NumericShaper in the java.awt.font package, and
Bidi, BreakIterator, and Normalizer in the java.text
package.

Non-Goals
Two related Unicode specifications will not be implemented by this JEP:

UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm, and
UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing.

Motivation
Unicode is an evolving industry standard, so we must keep Java to date
with the latest version.
Description
This is a follow-on to JEP 227, which introduced
Unicode 7.0 in JDK 9.  Unicode 8.0 adds an additional
~8,000 characters, 10 blocks, and 6 scripts.
Testing
We will need to verify that the latest Unicode data is correctly used by
the relevant classes.
Risks and Assumptions


Unicode 8 was released in June 2015.  While fairly late in JDK 9
development, it is important to always implement the latest Unicode
standard.  Deferring until JDK 10 would put us more than three years
behind.


It's possible that a minor update to the Unicode Standard (e.g.,
8.0.X) will be released before JDK 9 ships, in which case we may want
to consider incorporating that version.


Dependences
This feature depends on the Unicode Standard of the Unicode
Consortium.
