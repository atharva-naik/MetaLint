The convention is that all sections should use\nconsistent indentation. In each section, the header should match the\nindentation of the docstring's opening quotes, and the body should be\nindented one level further.\n\n\nThis rule is enabled when using the numpy and google conventions, and\ndisabled when using the pep257 convention.",
