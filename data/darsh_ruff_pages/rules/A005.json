Readers may mistake the first-party module for the\nstandard-library module and vice versa.\n\n\nStandard-library modules can be marked as exceptions to this rule via the\nlint.flake8-builtins.builtins-allowed-modules configuration option.\n\n\nThis rule is not applied to stub files, as the name of a stub module is out\nof the control of the author of the stub file. Instead, a stub should aim to\nfaithfully emulate the runtime module it is stubbing.\n\n\nAs of Python 3.13, errors from modules that use the same name as\nstandard-library modules now display a custom message.",
