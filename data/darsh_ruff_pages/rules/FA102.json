For example, if your\nproject targets Python 3.10 and above, adding from __future__ import annotations\ndoes not impact your ability to leverage PEP 604-style unions (e.g., to\nconvert Optional[str] to str | None). As such, this rule will only\nflag such usages if your project targets Python 3.9 or below.",
