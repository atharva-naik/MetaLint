    "why-is-this-bad": "In Python, the pass statement and ellipsis (...) literal serve as\nplaceholders, allowing for syntactically correct empty code blocks. The\nprimary purpose of these nodes is to avoid syntax errors in situations\nwhere a statement or expression is syntactically required, but no code\nneeds to be executed.\n\n\nIf a pass or ellipsis is present in a code block that includes at least\none other statement (even, e.g., a docstring), it is unnecessary and should\nbe removed.",
