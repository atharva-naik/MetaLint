By default, it's also enabled for earlier Python\nversions if from __future__ import annotations is present, as\n__future__ annotations are not evaluated at runtime. If your code relies\non runtime type annotations (either directly or via a library like\nPydantic), you can disable this behavior for Python versions prior to 3.9\nby setting lint.pyupgrade.keep-runtime-typing to true.",
