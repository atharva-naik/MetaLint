They also increase the cognitive load of reading the code.\n\n\nIf an import statement is used to check for the availability or existence\nof a module, consider using importlib.util.find_spec instead.\n\n\nIf an import statement is used to re-export a symbol as part of a module's\npublic interface, consider using a \"redundant\" import alias, which\ninstructs Ruff (and other tools) to respect the re-export, and avoid\nmarking it as unused, as in:\n\n\nfrom module import member as member\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use __all__ to declare a symbol as part of the module's\ninterface, as in:\n\n\n# __init__.py\nimport some_module\n\n__all__ = [\"some_module\"]",

The fix offered depends on the\ntype of the unused import. Ruff will suggest a safe fix to export first-party imports with\neither a redundant alias or, if already present in the file, an __all__ entry. If multiple\n__all__ declarations are present, Ruff will not offer a fix. Ruff will suggest an unsafe fix\nto remove third-party and standard library imports -- the fix is unsafe because the module's\ninterface changes.",
