    "why-is-this-bad": "The warnings.warn method uses a stacklevel of 1 by default, which\nwill output a stack frame of the line on which the \"warn\" method\nis called. Setting it to a higher number will output a stack frame\nfrom higher up the stack.\n\n\nIt's recommended to use a stacklevel of 2 or higher, to give the caller\nmore context about the warning.",
