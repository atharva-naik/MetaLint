    "what-it-does": "Checks for \"dummy variables\" (variables that are named as if to indicate they are unused)\nthat are in fact used.\n\n\nBy default, \"dummy variables\" are any variables with names that start with leading\nunderscores. However, this is customisable using the lint.dummy-variable-rgx setting).",
    "why-is-this-bad": "Marking a variable with a leading underscore conveys that it is intentionally unused within the function or method.\nWhen these variables are later referenced in the code, it causes confusion and potential misunderstandings about\nthe code's intention. If a variable marked as \"unused\" is subsequently used, it suggests that either the variable\ncould be given a clearer name, or that the code is accidentally making use of the wrong variable.\n\n\nSometimes leading underscores are used to avoid variables shadowing other variables, Python builtins, or Python\nkeywords. However, PEP 8 recommends to use trailing underscores for this rather than leading underscores.\n\n\nDunder variables are ignored by this rule, as are variables named _.\nOnly local variables in function scopes are flagged by the rule.",

    "fix-safety": "This rule's fix is marked as unsafe.\n\n\nFor this rule's fix, Ruff renames the variable and fixes up all known references to\nit so they point to the renamed variable. However, some renamings also require other\nchanges such as different arguments to constructor calls or alterations to comments.\nRuff is aware of some of these cases: _T = TypeVar(\"_T\") will be fixed to\nT = TypeVar(\"T\") if the _T binding is flagged by this rule. However, in general,\ncases like these are hard to detect and hard to automatically fix.",
