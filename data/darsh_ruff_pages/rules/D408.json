    "why-is-this-bad": "This rule enforces a consistent style for multiline numpy-style docstrings,\nand helps prevent incorrect syntax in docstrings using reStructuredText.\n\n\nMultiline numpy-style docstrings are typically composed of a summary line,\nfollowed by a blank line, followed by a series of sections. Each section\nhas a header and a body. There should be a series of underline characters\nin the line immediately below the header.\n\n\nThis rule enforces a consistent style for multiline numpy-style docstrings\nwith sections. If your docstring uses reStructuredText, the rule also\nhelps protect against incorrect reStructuredText syntax, which would cause\nerrors if you tried to use a tool such as Sphinx to generate documentation\nfrom the docstring.\n\n\nThis rule is enabled when using the numpy convention, and disabled\nwhen using the google or pep257 conventions.",
