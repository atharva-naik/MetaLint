    "why-is-this-bad": "It's unnecessary to call, e.g., dict() as opposed to using an empty\nliteral ({}). The former is slower because the name dict must be\nlooked up in the global scope in case it has been rebound.",
    "fix-safety": "This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as it may occasionally drop comments\nwhen rewriting the call. In most cases, though, comments will be preserved."
