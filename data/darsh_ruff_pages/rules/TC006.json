    "why-is-this-bad": "This rule helps enforce a consistent style across your codebase.\n\n\nIt's often necessary to quote the first argument passed to cast(),\nas type expressions can involve forward references, or references\nto symbols which are only imported in typing.TYPE_CHECKING blocks.\nThis can lead to a visual inconsistency across different cast() calls,\nwhere some type expressions are quoted but others are not. By enabling\nthis rule, you ensure that all type expressions passed to cast() are\nquoted, enforcing stylistic consistency across all of your cast() calls.\n\n\nIn some cases where cast() is used in a hot loop, this rule may also\nhelp avoid overhead from repeatedly evaluating complex type expressions at\nruntime.",
