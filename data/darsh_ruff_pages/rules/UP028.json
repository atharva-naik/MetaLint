    "fix-safety": "This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as converting a for loop to a yield from expression can change the behavior of the program in rare cases.\nFor example, if a generator is being sent values via send, then rewriting\nto a yield from could lead to an attribute error if the underlying\ngenerator does not implement the send method.\n\n\nIn most cases, however, the fix is safe, and such a modification should have\nno effect on the behavior of the program.",
