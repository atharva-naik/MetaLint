    "why-is-this-bad": "If you only need the keys or values of a dictionary, you should use\ndict.keys() or dict.values() respectively, instead of dict.items().\nThese specialized methods are more efficient than dict.items(), as they\navoid allocating tuples for every item in the dictionary. They also\ncommunicate the intent of the code more clearly.\n\n\nNote that, as with all perflint rules, this is only intended as a\nmicro-optimization, and will have a negligible impact on performance in\nmost cases.",
