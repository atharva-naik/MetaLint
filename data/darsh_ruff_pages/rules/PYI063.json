However, PEP 570 (introduced in Python 3.8) introduced\ndedicated syntax for positional-only arguments. If a forward slash (/) is\npresent in a function signature on Python 3.8+, all parameters prior to the\nslash are interpreted as positional-only.\n\n\nThe new syntax should be preferred as it is more widely used, more concise\nand more readable. It is also respected by Python at runtime, whereas the\nold-style syntax was only understood by type checkers.",
