    "what-it-does": "Checks for repeated equality comparisons that can be rewritten as a membership\ntest.\n\n\nThis rule will try to determine if the values are hashable\nand the fix will use a set if they are. If unable to determine, the fix\nwill use a tuple and suggest the use of a set.",
    "why-is-this-bad": "To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, it is common to\nwrite a series of equality comparisons (e.g.,\nfoo == \"bar\" or foo == \"baz\").\n\n\nInstead, prefer to combine the values into a collection and use the in\noperator to check for membership, which is more performant and succinct.\nIf the items are hashable, use a set for efficiency; otherwise, use a\ntuple.",
