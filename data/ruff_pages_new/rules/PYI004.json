    "what-it-does": "Checks for Python version comparisons in stubs that compare against patch\nversions (e.g., Python 3.8.3) instead of major and minor versions (e.g.,\nPython 3.8).",
    "why-is-this-bad": "Stub files support simple conditionals to test for differences in Python\nversions and platforms. However, type checkers only understand a limited\nsubset of these conditionals. In particular, type checkers don't support\npatch versions (e.g., Python 3.8.3), only major and minor versions (e.g.,\nPython 3.8). Therefore, version checks in stubs should only use the major\nand minor versions.",
