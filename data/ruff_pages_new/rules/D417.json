    "why-is-this-bad": "This rule helps prevent you from leaving Google-style docstrings unfinished\nor incomplete. Multiline Google-style docstrings should describe all\nparameters for the function they are documenting.\n\n\nMultiline docstrings are typically composed of a summary line, followed by\na blank line, followed by a series of sections, each with a section header\nand a section body. Function docstrings often include a section for\nfunction arguments; this rule is concerned with that section only.\nNote that this rule only checks docstrings with an arguments (e.g. Args) section.\n\n\nThis rule is enabled when using the google convention, and disabled when\nusing the pep257 and numpy conventions.",
