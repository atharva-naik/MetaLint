    "why-is-this-bad": "In Python, the + operator can be used to concatenate collections (e.g.,\nx + y to concatenate the lists x and y).\n\n\nHowever, collections can be concatenated more efficiently using the\nunpacking operator (e.g., [*x, *y] to concatenate x and y).\n\n\nPrefer the unpacking operator to concatenate collections, as it is more\nreadable and flexible. The * operator can unpack any iterable, whereas\n+ operates only on particular sequences which, in many cases, must be of\nthe same type.",
