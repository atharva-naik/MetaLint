    "why-is-this-bad": "PEP 8 recommends placing imports not only at the top-level of a module,\nbut at the very top of the file, \"just after any module comments and\ndocstrings, and before module globals and constants.\"\n\n\nimport statements have effects that are global in scope; defining them at\nthe top level has a number of benefits. For example, it makes it easier to\nidentify the dependencies of a module, and ensures that any invalid imports\nare caught regardless of whether a specific function is called or class is\ninstantiated.\n\n\nAn import statement would typically be placed within a function only to\navoid a circular dependency, to defer a costly module load, or to avoid\nloading a dependency altogether in a certain runtime environment.",
