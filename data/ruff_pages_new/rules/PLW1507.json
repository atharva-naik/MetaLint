    "why-is-this-bad": "os.environ is not a dict object, but rather, a proxy object. As such, mutating a shallow\ncopy of os.environ will also mutate the original object.\n\n\nSee BPO 15373 for more information.",

    "fix-safety": "This rule's fix is marked as unsafe because replacing a shallow copy with a deep copy can lead\nto unintended side effects. If the program modifies the shallow copy at some point, changing it\nto a deep copy may prevent those modifications from affecting the original data, potentially\naltering the program's behavior.",
