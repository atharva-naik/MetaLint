    "why-is-this-bad": "It is unnecessary to use set around a generator expression, since\nthere are equivalent comprehensions for these types. Using a\ncomprehension is clearer and more idiomatic.\n\n\nFurther, if the comprehension can be removed entirely, as in the case of\nset(x for x in foo), it's better to use set(foo) directly, since it's\neven more direct.",
