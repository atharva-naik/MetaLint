The print function always returns None, however,\nso the evaluated value of a call to print will always be None.\n\n\nUsing a print call in this context will therefore output the message to\nstdout, before raising an empty AssertionError(None). Instead, remove\nthe print and pass the message directly as the second expression,\nallowing stderr to capture the message in a well-formatted context.",
