This makes it easier to understand the desired behavior, which\ntypically corresponds to the latest Python versions.\n\n\nThis rule enforces the convention by checking for if tests that compare\nsys.version_info with < rather than >=.\n\n\nBy default, this rule only applies to stub files.\nIn preview, it will also flag this anti-pattern in non-stub files.",
