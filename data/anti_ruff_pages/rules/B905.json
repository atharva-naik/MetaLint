    "why-is-this-bad": "By default, if the iterables passed to zip are of different lengths, the\nresulting iterator will be silently truncated to the length of the shortest\niterable. This can lead to subtle bugs.\n\n\nPass strict=True to raise a ValueError if the iterables are of\nnon-uniform length. Alternatively, if the iterables are deliberately of\ndifferent lengths, pass strict=False to make the intention explicit.",
