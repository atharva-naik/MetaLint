    "why-is-this-bad": "Python 3.13 introduced the ability for type parameters to specify default\nvalues. Following this change, several standard-library classes were\nupdated to add default values for some of their type parameters. For\nexample, Generator[int] is now equivalent to\nGenerator[int, None, None], as the second and third type parameters of\nGenerator now default to None.\n\n\nOmitting type arguments that match the default values can make the code\nmore concise and easier to read.",
