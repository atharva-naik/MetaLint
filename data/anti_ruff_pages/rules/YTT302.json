    "why-is-this-bad": "Comparing sys.version to a string is error-prone and may cause subtle\nbugs, as the comparison will be performed lexicographically, not\nsemantically.\n\n\nInstead, use sys.version_info to access the current major and minor\nversion numbers as a tuple, which can be compared to other tuples\nwithout issue.",
