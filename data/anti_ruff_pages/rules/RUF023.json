    "fix-safety": "This rule's fix is marked as unsafe in three situations.\n\n\nFirstly, the fix is unsafe if there are any comments that take up\na whole line by themselves inside the __slots__ definition, for example:\n\n\nclass Foo:\n    __slots__ = [\n        # eggy things\n        \"duck_eggs\",\n        \"chicken_eggs\",\n        # hammy things\n        \"country_ham\",\n        \"parma_ham\",\n    ]\n\n\n\nThis is a common pattern used to delimit categories within a class's slots,\nbut it would be out of the scope of this rule to attempt to maintain these\ncategories when applying a natural sort to the items of __slots__.\n\n\nSecondly, the fix is also marked as unsafe if there are more than two\n__slots__ items on a single line and that line also has a trailing\ncomment, since here it is impossible to accurately gauge which item the\ncomment should be moved with when sorting __slots__:\n\n\nclass Bar:\n    __slots__ = [\n        \"a\", \"c\", \"e\",  # a comment\n        \"b\", \"d\", \"f\",  # a second  comment\n    ]\n\n\n\nLastly, this rule's fix is marked as unsafe whenever Ruff can detect that\ncode elsewhere in the same file reads the __slots__ variable in some way\nand the __slots__ variable is not assigned to a set. This is because the\norder of the items in __slots__ may have semantic significance if the\n__slots__ of a class is being iterated over, or being assigned to another\nvalue.\n\n\nIn the vast majority of other cases, this rule's fix is unlikely to\ncause breakage; as such, Ruff will otherwise mark this rule's fix as\nsafe. However, note that (although it's rare) the value of __slots__\ncould still be read by code outside of the module in which the\n__slots__ definition occurs, in which case this rule's fix could\ntheoretically cause breakage.",
