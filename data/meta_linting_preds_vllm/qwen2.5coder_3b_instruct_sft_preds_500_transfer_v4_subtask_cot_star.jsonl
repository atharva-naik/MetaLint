This could leak sensitive information, or allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.  \n\nFix:  \n- If `debug` is set to `True`, consider using a more secure approach, such as setting it based on an environment variable.

For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).  \n\nFix:  \n- On Python 3.12 and later, use `filter='data'` to prevent the most dangerous security issues (see: PEP 706).

Instead, consider safer formats, such as JSON. If you must deserialize untrusted data with pickle, consider signing the data with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing the payload. This will prevent an attacker from injecting arbitrary objects into the serialized data.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S302: suspicious-marshal-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `marshal.load()`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with marshal is insecure, as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Avoid deserializing untrusted data with marshal.

For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).  \n\nFix:  \n- On Python 3.12 and later, use `filter='data'` to prevent the most dangerous security issues (see: PEP 706). On earlier versions, set the `members` argument to a trusted subset of the archive's members.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S301: suspicious-pickle-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Calls to `pickle` functions or modules that wrap them, such as `pickle.load()`.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Avoid deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules. Instead, consider safer formats, such as JSON. If you must use pickle, consider signing the data with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S302: suspicious-marshal-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Calls to `marshal` functions, such as `marshal.load()`.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with marshal is insecure, as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Avoid deserializing untrusted data with marshal. Instead, consider safer formats, such as JSON. If you must use marshal, consider signing the data with a secret key and verifying the signature before deserializing.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S303: suspicious-insecure-hash-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Calls to cryptographic hash functions, such as `hashlib` functions.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to collision attacks or pre-image attacks, leading to security vulnerabilities.  \n\nFix:  \n- Use a known secure hash function such as SHA-256 or another secure option. Avoid weak or broken hash functions in security contexts.  \n\n---\n\nThis list outlines the code constructs to be analyzed along with the conditions for each idiom and potential fixes.

Here's an exhaustive list of the provided code constructs, conditions, and fixes as specified by the idioms:\n\n---\n\nIdiom S201: flask-debug-true  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `Flask()` and setting `debug=True`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Enabling debug mode shows an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs, and allows running arbitrary Python code from the browser. This could leak sensitive information, or allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.  \n\nFix:  \n- If `debug=True` is necessary, ensure it is only enabled in a development environment and not in production. Consider using environment variables to control debug settings.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S202: tarfile-unsafe-members  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `tarfile.open()` and `.extractall()` method  \n\nCondition:  \n- Extracting archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection is a security risk, as maliciously crafted archives may contain files that will be written outside of the target directory. For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).  \n\nFix:  \n- If possible, validate the contents of the archive before extraction. Use a whitelist approach to allow only specific files and directories. Alternatively, consider using more secure alternatives like `zipfile` for extracting files.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S301: suspicious-pickle-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `pickle.load()`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- If pickle is necessary, ensure that the data being deserialized comes from a trusted source and that proper validation and sanitization are in place to prevent object instantiation from arbitrary data. Consider using safer formats like JSON.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S302: suspicious-marshal-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `marshal.load()`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with marshal is insecure, as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- If marshal is necessary, ensure that the data being deserialized comes from a trusted source and that proper validation and sanitization are in place to prevent object instantiation from arbitrary data. Consider using safer formats like JSON.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S303: suspicious-insecure-hash-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of cryptographic hash functions such as MD5, SHA-1, etc.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to collision attacks or pre-image attacks, leading to security vulnerabilities.  \n\nFix:  \n- Use secure hash functions such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 for cryptographic applications.

For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).  \n\nFix:  \n- If `tarfile.extractall()` is used, ensure that the `members` argument is set to a trusted subset of the archive's members, or consider using `filter='data'` on Python 3.12 and later to prevent the most dangerous security issues.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S301: suspicious-pickle-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `pickle.load()`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Instead of using `pickle`, consider safer formats such as JSON. If deserialization with pickle is necessary, sign the data with a secret key and verify the signature before deserializing the payload to prevent arbitrary object injection.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S302: suspicious-marshal-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `marshal.load()`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with marshal is insecure, as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Instead of using `marshal`, consider safer formats such as JSON. If deserialization with marshal is necessary, sign the data with a secret key and verify the signature before deserializing the payload to prevent arbitrary object injection.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S303: suspicious-insecure-hash-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of cryptographic hash functions such as MD5, SHA-1, etc.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to collision attacks or pre-image attacks, leading to security vulnerabilities.  \n\nFix:  \n- Use a known secure hash function such as SHA-256 or SHA-512 for cryptographic purposes. If a specific hash function is required, ensure it is considered secure based on current best practices.  \n\n---\n\nThis list outlines the code constructs to be analyzed along with the conditions for each idiom and potential fixes.

Here's an exhaustive list of the provided code constructs, conditions, and fixes as specified by the idioms:\n\n---\n\nIdiom S201: flask-debug-true  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `debug=True` in Flask application configurations.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Enabling debug mode shows an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs, and allows running arbitrary Python code from the browser. This could leak sensitive information, or allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.  \n\nFix:  \n- Do not enable debug mode in production environments. If necessary, use environment variables to control debug mode based on the environment.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S202: tarfile-unsafe-members  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Use of `tarfile.extractall()` function.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Extracting archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection is a security risk, as maliciously crafted archives may contain files that will be written outside of the target directory. For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).  \n\nFix:  \n- Use the `filter='data'` option on Python 3.12 and later to prevent the most dangerous security issues (as per PEP 706). Alternatively, for earlier versions, specify a trusted subset of the archive's members using the `members` argument.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S301: suspicious-pickle-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Calls to `pickle.load()` or related functions.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Avoid deserializing untrusted data with pickle and instead consider safer formats such as JSON. Ifpickle must be used, sign the data with a secret key and verify the signature before deserializing the payload to prevent arbitrary object injection.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S302: suspicious-marshal-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Calls to `marshal.load()` or related functions.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with marshal is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.  \n\nFix:  \n- Avoid deserializing untrusted data with marshal and instead consider safer formats such as JSON. If marshal must be used, sign the data with a secret key and verify the signature before deserializing the payload to prevent arbitrary object injection.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S303: suspicious-insecure-hash-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Calls to cryptographic hash functions such as `hashlib` or `cryptography`.  \n\nCondition:  \n- Use of weak or broken cryptographic hash functions that may be susceptible to collision attacks or pre-image attacks, leading to security vulnerabilities.  \n\nFix:  \n- Use known secure hash functions such as SHA-256 or similar. If weak hashes must be used, ensure they are well-documented and contextually appropriate for the application's needs.  \n\nLine 12: Detected import statement but no relevant idiom applies.\n - Conditions for idiom S201, S202, S301, S302, or S303 do not apply here since there are no usages of `debug=True`, `tarfile.extractall()`, `pickle.load()`, `marshal.load()`, or cryptographic hash functions present.\n -

This could leak sensitive information, or allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.  \n\nFix:  \n- Use `os.environ[\"ENV\"] == \"dev\"` to conditionally enable debug mode based on an environment variable.  \n\n---\n\nIdiom S202: tarfile-unsafe-members  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- Usage of `tarfile.open(filename).extractall(path=tempfile.mkdtemp())`  \n\nCondition:  \n- Extracting archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection is a security risk, as maliciously crafted archives may contain files that will be written outside of the target directory. For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).  \n\nFix:  \n- On Python 3.12 and later, use `filter='data'` to prevent the most dangerous security issues (see: PEP 706).

Here's an exhaustive list of the provided code constructs, conditions, and fixes as specified by the idioms:\n\n---\n\nIdiom S201: flask-debug-true  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- `app.run(debug=True)`\n\nCondition:  \n- Enabling debug mode shows an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs, and allows running arbitrary Python code from the browser. This could leak sensitive information, or allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.\n\nFix:  \n- If possible, disable debug mode in a production environment by setting `debug=False` or using environment variables to control its state.\n\n---\n\nIdiom S202: tarfile-unsafe-members  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- `tarfile.open(filename).extractall(path=tempfile.mkdtemp())`\n\nCondition:  \n- Extracting archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection is a security risk, as maliciously crafted archives may contain files that will be written outside of the target directory. For example, the archive could include files with absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), or relative paths with parent directory references (e.g., `../etc/passwd`).\n\nFix:  \n- If extraction is necessary, ensure that the `members` argument is set to a trusted subset of the archive's members or use `filter='data'` on Python 3.12 and later to prevent the most dangerous security issues.\n\n---\n\nIdiom S301: suspicious-pickle-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- `pickle.load(file)`  \n- `pickle.dump(obj, file)`  \n- `pickle.dumps(obj)`  \n- `pickle.loads(data)`\n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with pickle and other deserialization modules is insecure as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.\n\nFix:  \n- If deserialization is required, consider safer formats such as JSON. If pickle must be used, sign the data with a secret key and verify the signature before deserializing.\n\n---\n\nIdiom S302: suspicious-marshal-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- `marshal.load(file)`  \n- `marshal.dump(obj, file)`  \n- `marshal.dumps(obj)`  \n- `marshal.loads(data)`\n\nCondition:  \n- Deserializing untrusted data with marshal is insecure, as it can allow for the creation of arbitrary objects, which can then be used to achieve arbitrary code execution and otherwise unexpected behavior.\n\nFix:  \n- If deserialization is required, consider safer formats such as JSON. If marshal must be used, sign the data with a secret key and verify the signature before deserializing.\n\n---\n\nIdiom S303: suspicious-insecure-hash-usage  \nCode Constructs to Analyze:  \n- `hashlib.new('md5')`  \n- `hashlib.new('sha1')`  \n- `hashlib.new('sha224')`  \n- `hashlib.new('sha256')`  \n- `hashlib.new('sha384')`  \n- `hashlib.new('sha512')`  \n- `hashlib.new('ripemd128')`  \n- `hashlib.new('ripemd160')`  \n- `hashlib.new('whirlpool')`  \n- Custom hash functions using `hashlib` or other libraries\n\nCondition:  \n- Weak or broken cryptographic hash functions may be susceptible to collision attacks (where two different inputs produce the same hash) or pre-image attacks (where an attacker can find an input that produces a given hash). This can lead to security vulnerabilities in applications that rely on these hash functions.\n\nFix:  \n- Use a known secure hash function such as SHA-256. If custom hash functions are necessary, ensure they are secure and well-documented.\n\n---\n\nThese constructs and conditions should help in identifying potential security risks related to the specified idioms in the code file.\n\nLine 1: Detected import statements for Flask, which are relevant to idiom S201:\n - Conditions for idiom S201 state that enabling debug mode shows an interactive debugger in the browser if an error occurs, and allows running arbitrary Python code.\n - There are no `app.run(debug=True)` calls present in the code file; therefore, this idiom does not apply here.\n - In conclusion, S201 is not violated!\n\nLine 3: Detected setting a secret key for Flask application, which is relevant to idiom S201:\n - The code sets `app.secret_key='I am a seekrit'`, which does not invoke the `app.run(debug=True)` call.\n - As such, this line does not trigger any violations related to S201.\n - In conclusion, S201 is not violated!\n\nLine 11: Detected route definition for '/deleteSesh', which is relevant to idiom S201:\n - The route definition does not directly invoke `app.run(debug=True)`.\n - Thus, there are no violations related to S201 present here.\n - In conclusion, S201 is not violated!\n\nLine 15: Detected route definition for '/byTwo', which is relevant to idiom S201:\n - Similar to line 11, this line does not invoke the `app.run(debug=True)` call.\n - Therefore, this line does not trigger any violations regarding S201.\n - In conclusion, S201 is not violated!\n\nLine 18: Detected redirect function which does not relate to any idiom violations:\n - The redirect function does not utilize any potentially risky constructs related to the specified idioms.\n - Thus, this line does not trigger any violations regarding S201.\n - In conclusion, S201 is not violated!\n\nLine 20: Detected entry point for the Flask application:\n - The code does not include any `app.run()` call that would enable debug mode.\n - Consequently, there are no violations related to S201 here.\n - In conclusion, S201 is not violated!\n\n### Final Idiom Violations Found\n\n**Idiom S201 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S202 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S301 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S302 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S303 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND", "ground_truth": "**Idiom S201 Violations:**\n\n{\"line\": \" 20     app.run(debug=True)\", \"span\": \"debug=True\", \"fix\": null}\n\n**Idiom S202 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S301 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S302 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n\n**Idiom S303 Violations:**\n\nNO VIOLATIONS FOUND\n", "error": false}
